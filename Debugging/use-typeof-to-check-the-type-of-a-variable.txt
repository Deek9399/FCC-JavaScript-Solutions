/*
You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.
